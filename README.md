# ML-Tests

This repository contains my practice on machine learning using a project from [IBM's Machine Learning with Python course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python).

## About
I've been actively learning machine learning techniques through the IBM course on Machine Learning with Python. This repository serves as a playground where I implement the concepts taught in the course.

### Project Details
- **Course:** Machine Learning with Python
- **Provider:** IBM
- **Topics Covered:** Various machine learning concepts and applications using Python
- **Experiments:** Implementing projects and exercises from the course

Feel free to explore the code and my experiments related to this machine learning course!
